    <p>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Whales are remarkably diverse, with 84 living species of dramatically different sizes and more than 400 other species that have gone extinct, including some that lived partly on land. </p>

        <p>Hippos are the closest living relatives of whales, but they are not the ancestors of whales. Both hippos and whales evolved from four-legged, even-toed, hoofed (ungulate) ancestors that lived on land about 50 million years ago. </p>

        <p>Over time their descendants spent more and more time in the water and their bodies became adapted for swimming. Their front legs became flippers and a thick layer of fat called blubber replaced their fur coats to keep them warm and streamlined. Eventually, their tails became bigger and stronger for powerful swimming and their back legs shrunk. Gradually, their nostrils moved to the top of their heads so that they could breathe easily without the need to tilt their heads while swimming. As some of these creatures began to feed on a different diet, they evolved into baleen filter feeders and lost their teeth.</p>

        <p>Whales play a vital role in the marine ecosystem where they help provide at least half of the  oxygen you breathe, combat climate change, and sustain fish stocks. Different species of whales feed on a range of marine creatures, including krill and fish, in the dark depths of the world’s oceans.</p>

        <p>Breaching is a form of surfacing behavior where most or all of the whale's body leaves the water. Many species do this, but some, such as humpbacks, seem to breach more frequently. There are many theories as to why whales do this: to communicate, attract other whales, or warn off other males. But no one really knows exactly why – yet. Whales blow air, water vapor and mucus as they surface to take a breath. Each whale species has its distinctive blow, such as small and bushy for humpbacks, V-shaped for southern rights and up to 12m high for blue whales.</p>

        <p>largest groups of mammals in the world when it comes to distribution locations. If you observe the behaviors of whales, you will find that they are quite social in nature. Humans are the only natural enemies that whales have. They would be able to do just fine out there if humans weren’t destroying their natural environment with pollution and toxins. </p>
